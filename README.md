Specific steps
Completely shut down your laptop.

Power on the system and as soon as the first logo screen appears, immediately press F2 to enter the BIOS.

Use the right arrow key to select Security tab.

Use the down arrow key to highlight Set Supervisor Password and press Enter.

Type some password and press Enter. Don't forget the password you enter!

Retype the password to confirm and press Enter again.

Use the right arrow key to select Boot tab.

Press the down arrow key to select Secure Boot and press Enter.

With the arrow key, highlight Disabled and press Enter.

Press the F10 key and select Yes to save the changes and exit the BIOS.

https://askubuntu.com/questions/326662/which-partition-to-select-as-device-for-boot-loader-in-an-efi-mode-install

While with BIOS/MBR systems you install to the MBR and almost never to a partition, with UEFI you always install to the efi partition. It actually should default to install to that partition anyway and you can only have one efi partition (with boot flag) per drive.

In your case installing grub to sda3 the efi partition is correct. You should see multiple folders for each system you have installed, in Ubuntu they are mounted at /boot/efi and on the drive you have ubuntu & Microsoft folders with boot files:

/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi

Grub2's os-prober has a bug and only creates BIOS boot entries which do not work with UEFI. You do not chainload to the Windows install like BIOS, but chain load to the efi partition. Boot-Repair can automatically create entries in 25_custom or you can manually add entries as shown in bug report to your 40_custom.

grub2's os-prober creates wrong style (BIOS) chain boot entry https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1024383 type of entry from Boot-Repair that should work. menuentry "Windows UEFI bkpbootmgfw.efi" { menuentry "Windows Boot UEFI loader" { Type of entry that does not work: 'Windows ...)

dd if=/dev/zero of=path/to/file bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc

The notrunc conversion option means do not truncate the output file â€” that is, if the output file already exists, just replace the specified bytes and leave the rest of the output file alone. Without this option, dd would create an output file 512 bytes long.

START GRAPHICAL LOGIN AFTER RASPBERRY PI IS TURNED OFF:

1) START RASPBERRY PI

2) WAIT 4 MINUTES - starting all services

ssh demouser@iprpi

sudo rc-service tigervnc start

3) WAIT 3 MINUTES - starting a second X session for display :1 in the background

sync

exit

4) Do not exit this console after the command to maintain tunelling link:

ssh -L 5902:localhost:5901 demouser@iprpi

ON THE RASPBERRY PI

mkdir -p /home/demouser/share

ON THE CLIENT

mkdir -p /home/pi/sshfsmnt

sshfs demouser@iprpi:/home/demouser/share /home/pi/sshfsmnt


In case of problems: they are created by apparmor or ssh tunneling, tigervnc is ok - test with no tunelling.

On server troubleshoot:

1) Uninstall apparmor if available on client and Raspberry Pi

2) Linux cmdline apparmor=0 on client and Raspberry Pi

3) Disable tigervnc service

sudo rc-update del tigervnc default

reboot

ps -ef |grep 5901

=====================

only bash shell, no VNC server

=====================

4) update OS on client that accesses Raspberry Pi because maybe security fix for keys

5) change tunnel port to target port to plus a few because maybe old port has old key configured


6) On Raspberry Pi:

sudo rc-service tigervnc start

sudo ps -ef |grep 5901

7) On client:

ssh -L 5902:localhost:5901 demouser@iprpi

xtightvncviewer 127.0.0.1:5902

NOT OK ?

On Raspberry Pi:

sudo rc-service tigervnc start

sudo ps -ef |grep 5901

# Nvidia Chromium vdpau accelerated h264 decoding on Arch Linux

 You need to install linux-lts linux-lts-headers linux-lts-docs and run:

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

 You need to compile as user and install as root some AUR packages with these steps:
 
 - creade a folder
 
 - put a PKGBUILD text file inside
 
 - run:
 
 cd
 
 cd folder
 
 makepkg -Acs
 
 - see what files are missing - patches, you can see them at Sources section on the AUR site for the package
 
 - create text files for the missing patches with the name in the Sources section and fill them
 
 makepkg -Acs
 
 pacman -U *.xz
 
 This are the AUR packages required:
 
 https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chromium-vaapi-bin/ or without -bin
 
 https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libva-vdpau-driver-chromium/
 
 This are the required "main repository" packages:
 
 pacman -Sy
 
 pacman -S libva-mesa-driver mesa-vdpau vdpauinfo libvdpau-va-gl 
 
 With X server off:
 
 pacman -R lxdm
 
 pacman -R gdm
 
 Install for Nvidia Geforce 8800GT and 9600GSO this:
 
 wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/340.107/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.107-no-compat32.run
 
 chmod +x NV*
 
 ./NV*
 
 Start Chromium, add extension h264ify
 
 https://askubuntu.com/questions/336302/gpu-accelerated-chromium
 
 
    Open the about:flags in your address bar
    
    Look for Override software redendering list
    
    Click "Enable"
    
    Restart Chrome/ium
 
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman
 
 The nvidia.ko module installed with .run file will need the exact kernel to be kept, not updated
 
nano /etc/pacman.conf
    
IgnorePkg=linux

IgnorePkg=linux-headers

IgnorePkg=linux-docs

IgnorePkg=linux-lts

IgnorePkg=linux-lts-headers

IgnorePkg=linux-lts-docs

 
 That's it. Tested and it works. To test that games work well:
 
 pacman -S warzone2100

# Debian experimental for select packages

https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/phoronix/latest-phoronix-articles/1111742-debian-11-bullseye-cycle-prepares-to-begin-long-journey/page2

Just to be clear though, experimental isn't a complete distribution. It's just an extra repository where maintainers can upload the latest stuff without immediately pushing it into unstable. It's meant for users of unstable who wants to pull in the latest of only some specific package. Recently I've used it for getting the latest mesa while Debian has been frozen these last few months, and it's great to have such a simple way to do that. Just don't try going into your apt sources list and change unstable to experimental. That won't work because experimental isn't an entire distribution in itself the way unstable and stable is. The way you do it is you have both unstable and experimental in your sources list, and whenever you want to install an experimental package you append '-t experimental' to apt, otherwise experimental packages will be ignored.

Example if I want latest gnome-shell and mutter and already have added the repo to my sources
Code:

sudo apt -t experimental install gnome-shell mutter

That way, nothing but gnome-shell and mutter will be from experimental. Everything else in my distribution will still be from unstable.

Fix all the files and the parity data.

All the files and the parity data are compared with the snapshot state saved in the last "sync". If a difference is found, it's reverted to the stored snapshot.

The "fix" command doesn't differentiate between errors and intentional modifications. It unconditionally reverts the file state at the last "sync".

# Par2 maximum continuous (.tar) archive file size is 1 TB

# 1 MB block size => 32 GB maximum for Usenet posts

# 32 MB block size => 32 x 32 GB = 1024 GB maximum for backups

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13615978

 Thanks for the heads up but that's not the one. I posted it in 1998 or 1999 and I tried to find the exact Usenet archive link similar to the direct link for Larry Page's famous 1996 post on comp.lang.java

To go back to the article, the author mentions posting the files to newsgroup "alt.binaries.backup". With Usenet, there isn't exactly a contractual SLA (Service Level Agreement) for that group. It's a gentlemen's agreement between those commercial Usenet providers (and non-commercials ones like universities) to replicate messages. Maybe because I posted the message to my GTE/Verizon ISP's Usenet server meant that it only got replicated to a few peers and it "died".

If my tiny text-based post which is 2 years newer than Larry Page's can't be recovered today, it doesn't give me lot of confidence to use Usenet as a backup solution. I have over 1 terabyte of photos, home videos, and tif scans of all my paper files. It's not appealing to chop that 1TB into a thousand PAR2 files with extra 20% redundant parity and posting it to alt.binaries.backup. That seems extremely fragile. Another commenter made a suggestion for Amazon's new personal "unlimited" cloud for $60/year. That seems much more reliable.


> It's not appealing to chop that 1TB into a thousand PAR2 files with extra 20% redundant parity and posting it to alt.binaries.backup.

For a 1 TB archive with 20% redundancy, you're looking at a block size of at least 32 MB in each par2 file (due to the maximum block count of 32767 in the official implementation). Given that the article size limit for many news servers is roughly 1 MB, you're looking at even a single block getting split into 32 article posts. par2 programs typically will generate a series of files where the smallest files contain a single block and the largest files contain 50 or more blocks. The 50 block files will each get split into 1600 articles.

For par2 recovery to work even when articles are missing, you really want the recovery block size to be less than the article size limit, so that even if one or more articles are missing, the par2 archiver program can still read a subset of blocks from the incomplete recovery file and still use them for recovery. That means that the maximum archive size would be roughly 32 GB to keep the block size under the article size limit.

Going beyond that size means that it's less likely that the recovery file would be usable if some of the articles are missing. At 32 GB, if one article is missing from a 3 block recovery file, the software will still be able find 2 blocks in that file. But, if the archive size was 100 GB, then the block size would be a minimum of 3 MB and just missing 3 out of 9 articles that make up a 3 block recovery file would make the recovery file unusable.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26429360/crc32-vs-crc32c

BTRFS uses CRC32C with polynomial 0x1EDC6F41, hardware accelerated in newer CPUs and quite good for bitrot detection, if you also have RAID1 mirror to repair automatically after detection even if it's a whole 4 KB sector missing which BTRFS does.

Swap files in Btrfs are supported since Linux 5.0

Displaying used/free space

General linux userspace tools such as df will inaccurately report free space on a Btrfs partition. It is recommended to use btrfs filesystem usage to query Btrfs partitions. For example:

btrfs filesystem usage /

Note: The btrfs filesystem usage command does not currently work correctly with RAID5/RAID6 RAID levels.

Btrfs supports online defragmentation through the mount option autodefrag. To manually defragment your root, use:

btrfs filesystem defragment -r /

Using the above command without the -r switch will result in only the metadata held by the subvolume containing the directory being defragmented. This allows for single file defragmentation by simply specifying the path.

Defragmenting a file which has a COW copy (either a snapshot copy or one made with cp --reflink or bcp) plus using the -c switch with a compression algorithm may result in two unrelated files effectively increasing the disk usage.

Parity RAID (RAID 5/6) code has multiple serious data-loss bugs in it.

Bitrot protection (repair) available if you use well tested RAID 1 (mirror) or RAID 10 (mirror striped)

Bitrot protection (repair) can be done if you use two partitions of the same size on the same one harddisk / ssd and put them in RAID 1 (mirror) or maybe even one partition with RAID1 made just inside it:

# BTRFS No space left on device

From live rescue mode enter a shell withowt chroot:

cat /proc/partitions

mount /dev/sdxx /mnt

cd /mnt

btrfs fi balance start -dusage=5 /mnt

rm /mount/point/var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb

btrfs fi balance start --full-balance /mnt

btrfs filesystem defragment -r /mnt


# But you use mirrored so half space half performance

https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Using_Btrfs_with_Multiple_Devices

https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/btrfs-raid1.html

https://seravo.fi/2016/perfect-btrfs-setup-for-a-server

Installing RAID1 for BTRFS
Debian does not support Btrfs RAID out of the box, so the way to go is to start to install BTRFS without RAID on one of the disk drives, leave the same space on a partition on the other drive(s), and then do

btrfs device add /dev/sdb3 /
btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1 /

We also add "degraded" as file system option in fstab; e.g.:

UUID=3d0ce18b-dc2c-4943-b765-b8a79f842b88 /               btrfs   degraded,strictatime        0       0

btrfs device delete missing tells btrfs to remove the first device that is described by the filesystem metadata but not present when the FS was mounted.
...
For example if you have a raid1 layout with two devices, and a device fails, you must:

    mount in degraded mode.
    add a new device.
    remove the missing device.

The UUID (check with blkid) is the same for both partitions in our RAID, so no need to specify devices.
EFI and RAID1
There is no support for RAID1 and EFI in Linux or Debian, so what we did was to have one EFI system partition (ESP) on each drive, let the Debian installer install the the EFI stub of grub on one of them, and then use dd to copy the contents of the ESP to the other ESP partition(s):

dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1

This has to be repeated every time the EFI partition changes, but it seems that this normally does not change, even when running update-grub. OTOH, it does not hurt to do the dd more often than necessary.

We also needed to change /etc/grub.d/10_linux in different places than "The perfect Btrfs setup for a server" (which seems to be written for a BIOS/MBR system) indicates: Search for " ro " (two occurences), and prepend "rootflags=degraded". One of these lines becomes

	linux	${rel_dirname}/${basename}.efi.signed root=${linux_root_device_thisversion} rootflags=degraded ro ${args}

In order for that to take effect, we had to

update-grub

What to do on a failed disk
We disconnected one of the disks (while the system was offline, online would have been an interesting variant) to simulate a disk failure. Due to a bug in BTRFS, it degrades nicely on the first boot, but then becomes irreversibly read-only on the second boot. If you get there, the best option seems to be to copy the read-only file system to a fresh and writable file system (with e.g., tar or cpio). (We actually went as far as having the read-only file system with one of the two drives we used, so the bug is still there in Linux 4.11).

You probably want to avoid these complications, and while you are still in your first boot, you can. What we did (with the other disk), is to convert it back from RAID1 to a single profile, then remove the failed device (which complains that it does not know the device, but still removes it).

btrfs balance start -v -mconvert=dup -dconvert=single /
btrfs device remove /dev/sdb3
#now check that it has worked
btrfs device usage /
btrfs fi show
btrfs fi usage

We then shut down the system, plugged the replacement disk in (actually the disk we had earlier ruined by double degraded booting, after wiping the BTRFS partition), booted and then did the usual dance to turn the now-single BTRFS into a RAID1 again:

btrfs device add /dev/sdb3 /
btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1 /

As a result, we had a RAID1 again.

If you wonder why we did not use btrfs replace: We would have to connect the new disk before the second reboot, which is not always practical. With the method above, once we have rebalanced the file system to a single one, we can reboot as often as we like to get the new drive online.

# BTRFS deal with databases and virtual harddisks without NOCOW

marc.merlins.org/linux/talks/Btrfs-LC2014-JP/Btrfs.pdf

If you have a virtual disk image, or a database file that gets written randomly in the middle,

Copy On Write is going to cause many fragments since each write is a new fragment.

My virtualbox image grew 100,000 fragments quickly.

You can turn off COW for specific files

and directories with chattr +C /path (new files will inherit this)

Or you can defragment the file:

btrfs filesystem defragment vbox.vdi

(could take hours)

cp â€“reflink=never vbox.vdi vbox.vdi.new; rm vbox.vdi

mv vbox.vdi.new vbox.vdi

(is much faster)

# Firefox on 4k displays or too little Full HD displays

https://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-get-firefox-looking-right-on-a-high-dpi-display-and-fedora/

Enabling the high DPI mode in Firefox is actually pretty simple, it is just a matter of setting the layout.css.devPixelsPerPx value in about:config to a value of 2 (i.e. double the size).
To do this, open up a new tab, and type about:config into the address bar, and press enter.
Then use the search box in this page to find the key layout.css.devPixelsPerPx and then change the value from -1.0 to 2

However, on closer inspection you will realise that the icons in the Firefox toolbar, while now the correct proportions, are now slightly fuzzy compared to the text. This is because the default Firefox theme ships bitmap icons that donâ€™t work well with High DPI displays.

The easiest way to fix this, and to make your Firefox fit that much better with the Fedora Workstation, is to install the GNOME Firefox theme. This theme uses scalable vector assets for the icons (SVGs) that look crisp and clean on a high DPI display.

Or...

https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=363772.75

It always keeps reset on the target chip - after program, to test, you need to remove connection and power it from somewhere else.

Compavr for atmega8 chip programmed with usbasp:

avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega8 -Wall -Os -o $1.elf $1.c

avr-objcopy -j .text -j .data -O ihex $1.elf $1.hex

# Fuses are for fast external oscilator like 12MHz !!! Not internal.

avrdude -c usbasp -p atmega8 -u -U hfuse:w:0xc9:m -U lfuse:w:0xef:m

avrdude -c usbasp -p atmega8 -U flash:w:$1.hex


0. Verify that you have a USBasp V2.0, and that it has a 12MHz crystal and an ATMEGA8 or ATMEGA8A MCU onboard. DO NOT CONNECT IT TO THE USB PORT OF YOUR COMPUTER.

1. Short the JP2 (self-programming) jumper.

2. Connect the USBasp V2.0 to the USBtinyISP using a 10-pin ribbon cable

# connect to vnc with tunneling (the server behaves as running on the client)

First open port 22 and 5900 (or all of them) on the router on the network to enter.

x11vnc connects to already open Desktop, doesn not make a new one, I like that

On the server make a vnc password, avoid anyone entering vnc server without a password (port 5900):

x11vnc -storepasswd

on the client (not ssh-ed in) in separate terminals or with an & after the first one do:

ssh -t -L 5900:localhost:5900 root@IPTARGET 'x11vnc -forever -localhost -display :0 -ultrafilexfer -auth /home/pi/.Xauthority'

or with more caching that reduces network usage (but introduces vertically down images used for cache):

ssh -t -L 5900:localhost:5900 pi@IPTARGET 'x11vnc -forever -localhost -ncache 2 -ncache_cr -ncache_no_rootpixmap -display :0 -ultrafilexfer -auth /home/pi/.Xauthority'

xtightvncviewer -encodings "copyrect tight hextile" -quality 5 -compresslevel 5 localhost:0

(maximum 400 kB/s when there are a lot of image changes, 5 kB/s at a static image with blinking cursor)

(Raspberry Pi 2 CPU at 34 % at maximum, but that's also because of the program changing the image)

# Copy files securely on the internet over ssh:

Create password for user diantokam

# passwd diantokam

Adding diantokam to samba user

# smbpasswd -a diantokam

Enable samba service on startup

# /etc/init.d/samba enable

To start samba service

# /etc/init.d/samba start

To stop samba service

# /etc/init.d/samba stop

To accesses samba share from windows type \\samba_server_name on address bar, in my case it is \\openwrt
