// When this bit is written logic one, the power to the Analog Comparator is switched off. This bit can be set
// at any time to turn off the Analog Comparator. This will reduce power consumption in Active and Idle
// mode. When changing the ACD bit, the Analog Comparator Interrupt must be disabled by clearing the
// ACIE bit in ACSR. Otherwise an interrupt can occur when the bit is changed.
